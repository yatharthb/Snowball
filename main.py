# Define the Snowball algorithm as a Process in simPy
class Snowball(simpy.Process):
    def run(self):
        # Implement the steps of the Snowball algorithm here
        pass

# Create an instance of the Simulation class
sim = simpy.Simulation()

# Create an instance of the Snowball algorithm and initialize the state
snowball = Snowball(sim)

# Start the Snowball algorithm process
sim.process(snowball)

# Run the simulation until the algorithm reaches consensus
sim.run()

# Print the final state of the algorithm
print(snowball.state)
In this example, the Snowball algorithm is defined as a Process in simPy. This allows the algorithm to be executed concurrently with other processes in the simulation.

To run the algorithm concurrently, an instance of the Simulation class is created and the Snowball algorithm process is started using the process method. The run method of the Simulation class is then used to run the simulation until the algorithm reaches consensus.

Once the simulation is finished, the final state of the algorithm can be accessed and printed. You can adjust the specific details of the concurrent execution to suit your needs and requirements.
